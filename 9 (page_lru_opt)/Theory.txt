🧠 CONCEPT (Simple Explanation)
🧩 What is Page Replacement?

When memory (frames) is full and a new page is needed, the OS must decide which old page to remove.
The strategy used to decide this is the page replacement algorithm.

💥 Page Fault:

When a page (number) is not found in memory, that’s a page fault.
The OS then loads it into a frame — sometimes replacing another page.

1️⃣ LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm

“Least Recently Used” = remove the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.

The idea:
The page not used for a long time probably won’t be used soon.

Example:
If your last uses were:
Page 2 (latest), Page 3, Page 1 (oldest)
→ remove Page 1 next.

Steps:

Keep track of recent usage order.

If new page comes:

If it’s already in memory → ✅ Hit.

If not in memory → ❌ Page fault → replace the least recently used page.

2️⃣ Optimal Algorithm

This is the best possible page replacement method.

It replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.

It’s used for comparison/testing, not real OS (since it needs future knowledge).

Steps:

Look at the future page requests.

For each page in memory, check when it will be used again.

Replace the one that is used farthest in the future.

⚖️ Comparison Table
Algorithm	How It Works	Advantage	Disadvantage
FIFO	Remove oldest	Simple	Can cause Belady’s anomaly
LRU	Remove least recently used	Good practical performance	Needs tracking
OPTIMAL	Replace page not used for longest future time	Minimum page faults	Not realistic (future unknown)
